		<h1> It's time for a quiz, students! </h1>
		<p> You'll see three links to Google Forms; click on any one of them to begin the mini-game quiz. </p>
		<p> Only one of the three links actually works and takes you to the <a href="Offical website w link.html">quiz</a>; the others are dead ends. <br / > However, keep in mind that each link provides a clue, a sentence, or anything that could be useful. </p>
